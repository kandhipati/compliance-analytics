# Project Notes: Compliance Data Analytics System

## Overview
This system automates the ETL process for employee compliance data, detects anomalies in compliance scores, and generates audit-ready reports.

## Key Observations
- Automated flagging significantly speeds up compliance monitoring.
- The anomaly detection threshold is based on statistical metrics, which can be fine-tuned.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models for more advanced anomaly detection.
- Integrate visualization tools to present trends over time.
- Expand data sources for a more holistic compliance view.

## Challenges
- Balancing sensitivity and specificity in anomaly detection.
- Maintaining data integrity across multiple ingestion processes.
